##Brief Bio:

I have been in the field of clinical research and biomedical informatics for the past 10 years during which
I have fulfilled roles pertaining to applied clinical informatics while maintaining an active research and
education presence. In my operational role as the Associate Medical Director of Informatics I have been
at the forefront of CDS innovation, pragmatic CDS implementations and have conducted and published
research on the same.

Following my training in Medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), I pursued a
masters at the highly reputed program in Biomedical Informatics at Columbia University and worked on
two NLM-funded projects on patient safety, medical devices and medical errors in the critical care
setting. A particular emphasis was around decision making in acute and critical care settings.
I lead CDS efforts from both an operational and research perspective at Weill Cornell Medicine. Projects
have ranged from improvements to medication alerts, preventative health care, research recruitment
decision support and use of CDS in determining the appropriateness of a radiology study being ordered
by physicians. One particular project has drawn widespread interest, that I have presented
Internationally and has recently been published in JAMIA pertains to how we dramatically increased
generic medication prescriptions over their more expensive brand counterparts by making changes to
the user interface to the ordering component of our Electronic Health Record. Besides institutional
projects I have worked on Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and NY state Department
of Health HEAL grants on evaluation of health IT systems in institutions across New York state. At
present I am leading the precision medicine to electronic health record (EHR) integration efforts and its
related CDS development for prospective genomic testing as well as variant based research recruitment
in cancer patients.

Along with my research and operational activities, I am also actively involved in quality and patient
safety committees at WCM/New York Presbyterian hospital (NYPH) and spend 15-20% of my time on
inpatient care as a hospitalist at NYPH.
